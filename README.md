# UMG Front End Coding Challenge

## Requirements

1) Build a shoppable lookpage for “Joe Artist” on Shopify. Use Shopify sections to give the end-user control over how the page content is populated, linked, etc.

2) Implement a simple Shopify cart using Typescript or Javascript
Support the following actions:
- Change quantity of existing cart item (updates state to render the new selection and submits to Shopify ajax cart change).
- Remove item from cart (updates state to render cart without this item, and submits the change to Shopify ajax cart)
- (optional) Conditional upsell product Y will display when product X is present in the cart. Add to cart will update the cart state and submit the change to shopify.
- (bonus) Disable all controls when a modification is in progress
